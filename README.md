# Copper Mountain Sokoban

WORK IN PROGRESS: This will be a very basic implementation of Sokoban. The one important difference is that the boxes 
and goals will be numbered.

The purpose of numbering the boxes and goals is to give Sokoban level designers another metric of how easy or difficult 
their levels are.

A level can start out with almost every box already on a goal and yet still be quite difficult because the player must 
move every one of those boxes to a different goal before being able to move the last box into a goal.

Contrast that to a level in which no box starts out on a goal, but the level can be quite easy if it's obvious to the 
player which box goes on which goal.
